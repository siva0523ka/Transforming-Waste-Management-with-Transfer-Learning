# ♻️ Waste Management with Transfer Learning

A deep learning-based project aimed at automating waste classification using transfer learning for smarter, faster, and more reliable waste management solutions.

## 📌 Introduction

With the exponential rise in global waste generation, traditional manual methods for waste segregation have become inefficient and error-prone. This project presents a machine learning solution leveraging transfer learning to automatically classify waste into different categories — aiding smart bins, automated robotics, and city-level tracking.

## 🎯 Objective

To develop a machine learning model using transfer learning (MobileNetV2) that accurately classifies waste images into predefined categories: **organic**, **recyclable**, **hazardous**, and **general**.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Language:** Python  
- **Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras  
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn  
- **Model:** MobileNetV2 (pretrained on ImageNet)  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / VSCode / Google Colab
